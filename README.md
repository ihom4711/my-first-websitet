# My very first website

Welcome!

This is my first readme.md for my very first web page.

First I have created a navigation bar to linking to different pages. Then I gave it some styling 
One of the most common ways to add styling to a website is usually to create a new folder inside a project directory.
I did that and called mine css and inside of the css folder created a new file called style.css. 
Then I created some styles.
The first I did was creating some rules for the body element to avoid the browser default paddings and margins so I've reset those to 0.
I've also changed the font to Oswald and default to  sans-serif if that's not available. 
Then I created the styles for my nav items, so the first thing I did is I created a rule for the ul inside of the nav and to say I want to remove the dots next to each of the links and I gave it a background-color of charcoal using the hex value.
Then I've aligned my text to the center and removed any additional margin and padding from my unordered list element so I've set margin: 0 and padding: 0. 
Then I styled each of my list items. font size to  1.2em line height of 40 pixels, height of each of my list item elements to 40 pixels. 
After that I wanted each item of my list to appear next to one another. 
To achieve that, I set the display property to inline-block and that will display each of the elements in line on the nav bar as opposed to stacked on top of one another. 
The next thing that I did was creating a margin to the left to create some breathing space between each of the list items.I just used 2.5%. 
Next styled each of my anchor elements. The main thing that I did was text-decoration:none to remove the underlines from each  of  my links. 
Then I set the textcolor to white.
Then I created some specific styles for when I hover over an a.  
Then I changed the color of the text to be the charcoal.
